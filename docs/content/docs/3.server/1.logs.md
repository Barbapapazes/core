description: How to use deployment server logs with NuxtHub.
---

Logs are live streams of the server logs from the deployment server. You can use them to monitor the progress of your deployments.


## NuxtHub console

Logs are available in the [NuxtHub console](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/) under the `Logs` section. You can access to the logs of each deployment in the `Deployments` section.


## NuxtHub CLI 

Using the NuxtHub CLI, you can access to the logs of both `production` and `preview` deployments.

```bash
nuxthub logs
```

You can also filter the logs by environment:

```bash
nuxthub logs --preview
```


```bash
nuxthub logs --production
```
