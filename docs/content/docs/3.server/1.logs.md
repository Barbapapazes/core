description: How to use deployment server logs with NuxtHub.
---

Logs are live streams of the server logs from the deployment server. You can use them to monitor the progress of your deployments.


## NuxtHub admin

When you have a successful deployment, you can access to the logs of the deployment in the [NuxtHub admin](https://admin.hub.nuxt.com/).  
Logs are available under the `Logs` section of your project page. You can also access to the logs of each successful deployment in the `Deployments` section.


## NuxtHub CLI 

Using the NuxtHub CLI, you can access to the logs of both `production` and `preview` deployments.

### Production environment

NuxtHub will automatically detect the canonical deployment of your project and stream the logs of that deployment in the CLI.

```bash
nuxthub logs --production
```

### Preview environment

In preview environment, NuxtHub will stream the logs of the latest successful deployment in the CLI.

```bash
nuxthub logs --preview
```
