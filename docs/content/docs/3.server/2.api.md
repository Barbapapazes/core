NuxtHub API generates a beautiful API documentation and playground for your NuxtHub project.

## Getting Started

NuxtHub uses Nitro's OpenAPI generation to access your NuxtHub project's API. To enable the API, you need to add enable Nitro's experimental `openAPI` feature. You can do this by adding the `nitro.experimental.openAPI` property to your `nuxt.config.ts` file.

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
defineNuxtConfig({
  nitro: {
    experimental: {
      openAPI: true
    }
  }
})
```
