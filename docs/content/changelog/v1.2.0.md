## Environment variables for GitHub deployment

In the GitHub deployment panel, you now have the capacity to add environment variables as secrets. These secrets help you manage reusable configuration data. They are created directly within your [GitHub repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions). Our GitHub Pages configuration file is automatically updated to incorporate these variables, making them accessible in your source code after the deployment process.

A new permission for the GitHub App will be requested concerning `secrets`. It allow secrets creation on your behalf.
