Move the editor from left to right and vice versa to preview your website the way you want. Easily switch between layouts using the command menu, thanks to the 'Switch to default/reversed Studio layout' action.

## Automatic preview comments

![User preferences with preview comments toggle](/assets/changelog/automatic-preview-comments.png)

By default, when your project is imported to Nuxt Studio, the option for automatic PR preview comments is enabled. This means that Nuxt Studio will automatically post a message on your PR feed whenever it detects changes to your content pages, providing a direct link for previewing the modifications.

You have the flexibility to deactivate the automatic preview comments initiated by Nuxt Studio. Simply access your project's settings page and disable this functionality as needed.
