## The Notion-like Editor for Markdown

:video{autoplay controls loop poster="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1706110195/studio/studio-content-editor_mpqyig.jpg" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/nuxt/video/upload/v1706110195/studio/studio-content-editor_mpqyig.mp4"}

We are thrilled to announce the beta version of our new Content editor, with a Notion-like experience. Developed on the robust foundation of Tiptap, we've been working on it for the past four months. **Edit your markdown, integrate Vue components and update their slots and props â€”all without requiring expertise in Vue, Nuxt, or even Markdown syntax.**

The editor works seamlessly with your team as it **supports live collaboration**.

The editor generates [MDC syntax](https://content.nuxt.com/usage/markdown#introduction)under the hood. You still have the flexibility to manually switch to the code editor if you hit any limitations that our editor does not fully support (yet).

We value the active participation of our users in shaping the evolution of our product. That's why we extend a warm invitation for you to [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/sBXDm6e8SP) and complete the [beta form](https://forms.gle/zn6W4TwKcv9p4aU79) to gain access to this new feature. A dedicated channel will be at your disposal to share valuable feedback and report any bugs you encounter. Our team is committed to promptly address and resolve any issues that arise.
