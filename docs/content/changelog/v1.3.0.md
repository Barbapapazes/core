At NuxtLabs, we've been working on [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com) for several years. Initially an internal library for our SaaS products ([Studio](https://nuxt.studio) and [Volta](volta.net)), it evolved into a sustainable solution that we recently decided to open-source.

[Nuxt UI Pro](https://ui.nuxt.com/pro) is a collection of premium components, an extension of Nuxt UI, designed to facilitate the creation of appealing and responsive Nuxt applications in a matter of minutes.

The Nuxt UI team is dedicated to deliver the best integration and customization experience, while the Studio team is providing full compatibility with Nuxt Studio. This collaborative effort follows a coherent direction, leading to the selection of UI Pro as the foundation of our templates ecosystem.

## From Docus to Docs template

We've made the choice to remove [Docus](https://docus.dev) from the list of our themes in profit of the [UI Pro Docs template](/themes/docs) as we offer a better maintenance for it in the future.

While Docus remains compatible with Studio, it won't be proposed as our official starter. UI Pro and Studio teams are focusing their efforts on maintaining and ensuring compatibility specifically for the UI Pro starters.

If you want to migrate from Docus to the new Docs template, you can follow our migration guide.
